Dataset
The dataset was from MVA Vehicle Sales Counts by Month for CY 2002 - 2015 . This dataset is
intended for public access and use. At beginning, I got some inspiration from
http://thestoryoftheseason.com/ which author Anna Powell Smith created a excellent
interactive annimation linear graph that shows football match points and position of each
team in UK, but when Iâ€™ve download dataset, I reconized that it is not complete, so I sent her
email and asked for the rest of data, she told me that actually she calcauted that data from raw
data, so I changed my mind to do this graph, but her graph gives me very good start point to
think of what I am going to do and make a big picture for that. I want to find some similar
structure dataset and went to a lot of dataset website and search for my ideal dataset. After 3
days, Finally I got it at DATA.GOV. I download it as csv format and later transfer them to
JSON format in javascript.
